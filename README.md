### What is Epoch Time
  In computing, an epoch is a date and time from which a computer measures system time. Most computer systems determine time as a number representing the seconds removed from particular arbitrary date and time.  
  As this is time to measure system time this is not at all readable. For e.g This is Epoch time "1554246802.464067" from this one can not understand date and time.
